    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks to use strong passwords, and that they should consider two-factor authentication for the site as well. To protect the website from attacks I would advise them to configure their website server to use HTTPS. HTTPS protects the website from attacks by encrypting the data, and the data will be securely sent between the web browser and the server. Finally, I would advise a potential client to secure his/her website by using Vulnerability Scanners which are automated tools that scan web applications to look for security vulnerabilities.</p>
